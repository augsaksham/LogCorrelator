I've created a Python repository for automated well log correlation. The process involves training a 1D Convolutional Autoencoder using PyTorch, which learns higher-dimensional representations of well log expressions. The training data is generated by windowing extractions from well logs.

For well log correlation, I compute feature vectors, identify key points, and generate cost and lag distance matrices. Local minima in the cost matrix indicate matching points, forming correlations between well logs. These matching points are added to a NetworkX graph for further analysis and interpretation.
